overview:
    - Exotag is a project that I co-founded with several friends.
    - Exotag addresses the problem of blood product wastage at Stanford University Hospital. This problem costs Standford approximately $350K/year.
    - We were awarded a spectrum grant to develop the solution.
    - We have since iterated through several generations of requirements and solutions finally landing on our latest prototype device.
tools:
    - Sketch, ProtoPie, Xcode, Vue.js, CSS

Detail view that shows the temperature history of the blood product.

During transportation, blood products must be maintained between 1-10 ÂºC or else they must be thrown away. Based on thermodynamic models, our device is able to anticipate when a blood product will go out of that range and alert hospital staff.

When the blood product is returned to the blood bank, the staff uses our mobile app to connect to the device and view it's temperature profile. It was important that the process be quick and easy in order to avoid disrupting current workflows.
