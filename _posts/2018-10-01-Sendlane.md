overview:
    - As Sendlane entered a growth period and began looking for investment, it became clear that if we were going to compete with the likes of Active Campaign and Mail Chimp, we needed to modernize our core email automation feature.
    - Users were having a hard time discovering how to use the feature and it was expensive for the support team to teach them one-on-one.
    - At the same time, as a small team, we needed to stay lean and make improvements quickly.
    - Over the course of several months, I redesigned the feature and worked with the development team to launch it.
outcome:
    - The framework and associated components that were developed for this feature laid the foundation for a broader refresh of the entire platform.
    - Unforunately we were unable get quantitative results due to a lack of analytics tools but the customer support team was very happy with the results and our users were too.
tools:
    - Sketch, Vue.js, Buefy, Bulma, CSS

The project was much more than a redesign of the automation feature. Rather, it created a new framework and component library that was used to redesign the entire platform.

A new style guide was implemented during feature development that went on to supersede the existing brand and UI styles.
